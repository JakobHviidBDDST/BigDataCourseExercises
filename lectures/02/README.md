# Lecture 02 - HFDS and different file formats

This week's exericses will be using the case based structure described in the general overview from lecture 01's exercise:

- You will be presented with a case that needs to be solved
- You must draw up the architecture you deem can solve this solution (use your prefered drawing tool, e.g. draw.io, Excalidraw, etc.)
    - Ideally using the technologies seen in the course so far
- Once the architecture has beeen drawn, attempt to assemble it with the chosen technologies

The new technologies introduced this week are: **HDFS, Avro and Parqeut**

For some general quick start guidance on utilising the technologies, please view the archived exerises from [Lecture 02 E24](https://github.com/JakobHviidBDDST/BigDataCourseExercises/tree/main/archive/E24/02)
