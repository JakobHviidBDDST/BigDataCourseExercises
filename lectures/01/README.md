## Exercise lectures

The format of the exercise lectures is as follows:

- Two modules of 45 minutes each per week.
- Each module will contain a case, based on the themes of the lecture, where you must pick and connect the appropriate technologies to solve the case, and then apply said technologies.
- To help familiarize yourselves with the technologies, please refer to the archived exercises for [E24](https://github.com/JakobHviidBDDST/BigDataCourseExercises/tree/main/archive/E24), as these contain guides and usage examples for the technologies.
- A proposed solution for the case will be published before the next lecture. 
- The first half of the first module will be used for recap and solution sharing from the previous exercises. The
  remainder of the first module and the second module will be used to work with the exercises for the current week.
- The exercises will be provided in `README.md` file in the respective lecture folder.

Please open issues [here](https://github.com/jakobhviid/BigDataCourseExercises/issues) if you encounter unclear
information or experience bugs in our examples!
